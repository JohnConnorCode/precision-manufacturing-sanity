    "title": "Our Story",
    "paragraph1": "Integrated Inspection Systems was founded in 1995, starting in a residential basement with a desk, computer, and a pair of calipers. Our founders came from Precision Castparts Inc, bringing aerospace expertise and a commitment to quality. From 1995-1996, we established cash flow through small business networking while developing a comprehensive quality manual. We then leased our first Zeiss CMM from Hanard Machine in Salem, Oregon, and began serving the plastics industry with a focus on precision metrology.",
    "paragraph2": "Our breakthrough came when we applied aerospace GD&T principles to high-volume metrology, a capability few suppliers could match. This led us to purchase our own Zeiss CMM in late 1998 and move to Beaverton, Oregon. We developed proprietary software, MetBase, which revolutionized our ability to integrate CMM data, CNC machines, and vision systems into a closed-loop manufacturing system. By 2001, we had developed a 3-sigma machining system and relocated to our current 20,000 square foot facility in Clackamas, Oregon.",
    "paragraph3": "Today, we're an ISO 9001 and AS9100 certified, ITAR-registered provider of engineering, metrology, machining, and database services. Our 3-sigma manufacturing system and proprietary MetBase software enable us to deliver industry-leading precision components for aerospace, defense, and advanced industries.",
